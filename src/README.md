# AOC 2024
## How to run
```bash
AOCSESSION=%YOURSESSIONKEY% zig run src/main.zig -- --day #
```

Where # is the number of the day you are trying to solve.


## TODO
- Solve for all days
- Make it so you can also solve all the available days instead of just one.
- Add preqrequisits (well only zig is required from https://ziglang.org/)
